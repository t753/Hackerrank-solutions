# Hackerrank

These are hackerank solutions. The only one that doesn't pass is "build a string.cpp". For that there is a hackkerank version and a test version (for testing with an input file). I've uploaded test 6 and test 11 input and output files for that. It passes testscases 0-5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, and 17 with no timeouts. The tests that fail are getting excessive b's. Test 6 gives one extra b for the the 3rd test in that testcase, and in test 11, the code gives 204 extra b's in the 3rd test for that testcase. If you can debug it let me know at tenglish1357@live.com
